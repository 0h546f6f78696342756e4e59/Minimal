>> NOTES <<
Run on a fresh VPS under root!
There's currently a non issue bug on KVM, if the script prompts to remove grub/kernel, say no, the script will continue to work as normal.
Make sure you don't rely on sudo, you'll get locked out!
No warranty. For help come on #Frantech on irc.dairc.net and look for maxexcloo!
